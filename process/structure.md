- Management of the sub-project lifecycles (i.e., Incubator, Active, Emeritus when incubators take the project into a new technology direction or existing projects want to split or merge) 
- Assessing Infrastructure needs for sub-projects, and making recommendations to the Open Mainframe Project TSC for any resources needed
