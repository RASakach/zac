# Zowe project role definitions

This document defines the roles of the Zowe sub-project within the development community. The Zowe sub-project generally has the following roles. It's expected that sub-projects have more specific definition of the roles as it pertains to that sub-project's community.

## Adopters

An "Adopter" uses the frameworks and technology provided by Zowe to extend and craft their own offerings. These offerings can be internal or external. When external, these offerings can be made available either commercially or free of charge.

## Contributor

A "Contributor" is an individual that wishes to contribute code or documentation to Zowe.

All code contributions to Zowe are to be made under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-2.0.html) and all non-code contributions are to be made under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html) unless otherwise approved by the Open Mainframe Project Governing Board. Code contributions are required to align with the [licensing and copyright notice guidelines](LicenseAndCopyrightGuidance.md) and follow the [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Process for Becoming a Contributor

* Review the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in each project repository for guidelines to ensure your contribution is in line with the project's coding and style guidelines.

* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO signoff.
* Have your submission approved by the Committer(s) and merged into the codebase.
* Stay current with conversations, reviews and questions about your contribution to aid in the evaluation and acceptance of the code.

## Committer

A "Committer" is an individual who has been given the right to commit code to a sub-project of Zowe. Guidelines for how to commit and the Committer status is defined and approved by each sub-project, and is subject to revocation if the individual is in violation of the Code of Conduct by the ZLC.

Rights and responsibilities of a Committer include, but are not limited to the following:

* Review and merge pull requests into a sub-project's repository(s).
* Track, participate in, and vote on relevant discussions in their associated projects.
* Proactively report problems in the bug tracking system, and annotate problem reports with status information, explanations, clarifications, or requests for more information from the submitter. Committers are responsible for updating problem reports when they have done work related to the problem.
* Be responsive to questions raised about the sub-project on mailing lists and other mediums.

### Process for Becoming a Committer

* Demonstrate your experience with the codebase through contributions and engagement on the community channels.
* Normally the community is aware of activities by Contributors and ideally a nomination would be made by an existing committer.  However, self nomination is an acceptable means of identifying your interest.  This interest should be expressed in an appropriate e-mail channel; the only persistent means of communication.  See the  [community repo](https://github.com/zowe/community/) for more details.
* The existing community (project) that is considering your membership would facilitate a vote (see voting).
* Once approved and granted access the new Committer will add their name and email to the [COMMITTERS.md](https://github.com/zowe/community/tree/master/COMMITTERS.md) file in the [Community repository](https://github.com/zowe/community/).

### When Does a Committer Lose Committer Status

If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties listed above, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of the committers per the voting process.  Commit writes will be suspended while emeritus.  In the future, if the Committer Emeritus wishes to rejoin they can contact the community via e-mail for re-instatement.  Prior contributions will be considered and a vote can ensue quickly to determine restoration of write access.

## Lead

A "Project Lead" is an individual elected by the Committers of a given sub-project, who oversees the development done by a sub-project. Collectively, Zowe sub-project leads are responsible for ensuring that their sub-project's committers are following the Development Process, and that the project is engaging in the right sorts of activities to develop vibrant communities of users, contributors and committers.  Each project lead is equal in responsibility.  Subsequently, additional project leads must be elected by the project's committers.
