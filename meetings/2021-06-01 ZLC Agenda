1) Any comments on Support Conformance? https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/182 I think this need to be a voting topic and 
we need to allow TSC some time to decide on the asks we make of them in the criteria - 
we also need to come to agreement on who owns the definition of  "core" contents. 

    Process for defining "core" - TSC or ZLC? 
    Confirm there is authentication process for z/OS, distributed, (and containers)
    TSC policies and practices (code quality, automated test, doc, etc.) - maybe include practice of 90 day to contribute back and what to do/say about customer validation of a fix
    How to define an active contributor?


2) We have separate issue on core https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/170 and we need to decide if this is in ZLC charter, TSC charter or 
some combination of both. 

3) Future of ZLC https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220 - to align with TSC
