1) Japan OMP event - who has the "pen" - 25 minutes presentation on the Zowe. 10:30am - 10:55am Japan local time
Zowe - Simplify the access to the MainFrame - recorded with live Q&A? 
    
2) ZAC charter - please read and comment - John has questions on charter and if he does then others will too. I would rather not eat up
more time in this meeting hashing out the words. https://github.com/zowe/zlc/tree/armstro-patch-4 If I screwed up the github PR - I need
some help making it editable. 
    - Two issues came up as I tried to document what we discussed 
    1) if we increase seats, limit to 2 seats per company then how to handle empty seats and still honor the OMP transparency rules 
    2) what is the criteria beyond being silver members being eligible - we discussed 1 conformant badge but that may be 
    too limiting - what if a customer wants to join? 
Let's figure out what we want - get OMP agreement - then work with TSC on any adjustments 

3) Any update from the TSC? 
    
4) Survey results - many thanks to Rose for collecting the responses - there are two files (summary and detail) - we can scan 
the summary data but should discuss how to do analysis. I thing detail report needs to be scanned to be sure no personal identifying
content include by mistake. I recommend we just let everyone see/use the summary but we should read the detail before releaseing. 
Where do we want to post the summary report? 

5) ZLC/ZAC - lets DO spend time on issues needing worked - https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues - would someone sign up to OWN an item and 
bring back next week for discusion? 3 items - 20 mins each 

6) SHARE - does anyone have a consolidated list of Zowe SHARE sessions we could help advertise? 

Any other topics?
