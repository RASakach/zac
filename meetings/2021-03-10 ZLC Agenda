Peter Fandel out this week 

1) Any feedback on SHARE attendance? I was asked and did not know - have not been able to attend. 
I think Zowe sessions are all next week. 

2) Let go through issues to know how far behind we are https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues discuss priorities
- Test environment has evolved into documenting 2021 requirements (as Marist is spread thin)
- Getting ZLC/ZAC and TSC charters aligned likely next 
- Support conformance program - woefully behind 

3) March 8 John sent out email indicating there are 9 applicants to Zowe for Mentorship - I know of one (Arijit) 
that has been accepted and helping Doc/Web squad. I have question to Ashley whether he's onboard - do we have 
Mentors for the other 8? 

4) Speaking of zowe.org - I see Overview video at the 2018 version but I recall seeing a new (great) overview - 
anyone know the status? 

5) We are reserving time next week for incubator proposal - Mike D. helping to organize. 

6) Any topics from the TSC? 

7) Is anyone collect events/conference the teams are trying cover? I saw a list from one indivudal and wondered 
if others are submitting to same conferences (no harm - just asking if we need to be more coordinated in approach) 

IDUG Europe, GSE UK Europe, GSE Enterprise Modernization, OMP Summit, Open Source Summit Europe, Marist College
 enterprise computing conference https://ecc.marist.edu/web/conference2021

Any other topics?
