Agenda items

1) Presentation by Broadcom hackathon participant on simplifying Zowe install

2) a good plan in place for IBM, Rocket and Broadcom to communicate the implications and required actions 
related to V2 conformance to all of their team contacts associated with current V1 conformance badges.  
For other companies like SEGUS and Phoenix etc., I've already reached out to John Mertic to see if he 
can provide the names and email addresses from each of the applications so that I can personally reach out.  
As part of the discussion on Tuesday I'd also like to solicit feedback about how to best prepare those 
teams for any changes they need to make.  I've considered maybe a series of office hours sessions?  
Or maybe a webinar with live Q&A?
