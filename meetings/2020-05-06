1) LTS and Conformance info posted on zowe.org - thanks to everyone that helped make that happen. 
  - Please review content to look for any errors - see Release Timeline on https://www.zowe.org/ page 
  - Conformance page just says "Conformant" in example badge - just confirming, are we closed on V1 for future badges - just none issued yet? 
  - Is OMP going to help contact existing badge owners? 
  
2) Let's run through github issues https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues 

3) Can we begin PI Planning planning?
