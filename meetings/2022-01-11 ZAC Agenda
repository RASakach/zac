     ii. Onboarding?
     iii. Update slide deck (Bruce/Mike)
     iv. Other actions?

  d) Remaining Vendor-Neutral - 
     i. Zowe MFA documentation explicitly calls out IBM Z Multi-Factor Authentication.  
        - Is this a slippery slope?
        - Does this imply that Zowe is owning validation?
        - How would another vendor get their solution included?
        - Should we consider an alternate approach?

      i. Should we proceed with the scheduled PI Planning dates?
      ii. ZAC Business context
         - What do we want to feature in this session?  Chat?  V2?  
         - Should we continue to present PI achievements?
         - If so, would anyone else like to present that this quarter?
         
   f) Quarterly Update
      i. Should we:
         - Attempt to proceed with a January update (and feature Chat)?
         - Defer until later in the quarter?
         - Skip this quarter?
