Some of the Broadcom team have a conflict today 

1) Any recap from OMP webinar? Thanks Rose and everyone for making a success! I think attendanced peaked about 50.
Anyone know if replay posted? 

2) PI Planning deck -  Mike D has the pen, finalize today - 30 mins tomorrow 8am eastern 
        Mike/Peter/Bruce tag team on slides 
        Do we want to say anything about chatops for future? 

3) Time table for Support Conformance implementation? When does John want to announce and work backwards? 
                
4) ZLC survey questions - call them done? please review

4) Priorities for ZLC/ZAC next PI 
        - Close of new charter? https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220 
        - V2 messaging 
        - Work with TSC on principles
