- Peter out this week and next 
- Need to wrap up today's call a little early for another call 

1) July 21 Webinar planning - 
- Focus Topic: Zowe Explorer Team Configuration
- New conformance programs (Support & Explorer), the "upvoting" approach the squads have adopted and the typical upcoming events
- Request out to MicroFocus and Segus 
- Maybe shout out on new doc site since it should be live then? 
- I assume 1 slide on Support Conformance - maybe treat as "request for comments"? 
- Status of survey questions? Is thelp needed? 

2) Request sent to Dan Jast and Sujay asking for Zowe sessions accepted for Share - see titles below - Note these are for the Open 
Track only. Do we have a merged list somewhere. 

3) Work continues on future of ZLC. Working session last week on how to differentiate the role with TSC.  
 https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220 - to align with TSC 
https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/charter.md 

4) Doc squad use of Watson - two questions - 1) Does this pass the test of "vendor neutral" 2) Who pays once usage become billable? 

5) https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues - added Certification Testing https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/225
