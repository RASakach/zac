No meeting last week - I hope everyone enjoyed some time off 

1) July 21 Webinar planning - one week from tomorrow 
        - Webinar registration link:  https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_8-Ktj-0NQYeA1RGXA-dhXQ
        - Mike D to pitch the Support Conformance proposal, see slide #2 of the deck - https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/182 

2) To finish the Support Conformance spreadsheet 
        - Link to "TSC Engineering Standards, policy and practices" - can we just link to TSC charter? We are saying Support Vendor 
        needs to recogize the TSC? 
        - Added a link that defines "core" (TSC has voted - 
        https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/release.md#the-core-attribute) 
        - Pointer to definition of active contributor - do we also point to TSC charter? 
        - Question - Series Manager defined somewhere in the TSC charter? I assume it means John Mertic as Series Manageer for OMP/LF? 

3)  Status of ZLC survey questions - 
        I added one on Support Conformance? Need additional ideas. 
        Mike - something on PSI? 
        MFA adoption? Might drive need for proposed hill below 
        Do we want to ask something about V2? Maintenance planned for 2 years? Is that acceptable?

        - Other squads: https://ibm.box.com/s/8haadp94pvoto8d60v0osu51m0ccx4o0  

4) PI Planning is coming up - ZLC input? https://ibm.ent.box.com/notes/825858992881 ZLC to provide a slide on "state of the business" 
            - Close of current hills
                - Containerization with Kubernetes 
                - Certificates - do we need to seek help from the z/OS team? 
                - V2 and all that entails (Dev stream/branch, New Conformance criteria, new FMID, warning messages for depricated items...)
                - Finish HA (this PI with Redis in future) 
            - Future hills
                - Improved install/config - especially with security (MFA, Certificates, ....) 
                - What is next after CII certification - OpenSSF is the eventual replacement for CII. Sorry Mark - I recall you 
                commenting on this but I could not find the words - may have rolled off slack. 

                - Chat as the next user interface technology?  
                - Request for built in NPS instrumentation?
                - Education/certification (needed for Support Conformance)? 
                - Sysplex enablement of Marist? New Z box?

From Node team on new versions: 

Last Thursday we had guests from the Node.js responsible for Release schedule of Node.js. The discussion took first 35 minutes 
of the TSC call and recording is available here:
 https://zoom.us/rec/share/4xvkXX7scXWY2J-hSPQqOmkhvIwN3USqFuuvBhTRgbNQEANW1pvvTZdkT-Pvncte.16ymtAl3E9NiWu2I
Notes from the meeting:
The current process is in place for 6 years. The Node.js community distinguishes between master (unstable), 
current(newest features in fast cycle), active(newest features in less frequent cycle) and maintenance(Only security fixes) 
releases. The timelines are visible here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/
Current - Basically Beta, happens every 6 months
Active  - Get features verified in Current for 12 months. Release once as a patch version per month, once a quarter as minor.
Maintenance - Ad-hos critical updates for 18 months
The breaking changes are introduced only on the borders of the releases. Meanwhile the breaking changes are kept 
only in the master branch. They are signalled upfront by marking behavior as deprecated. Deprecation can be added anytime. 
Once it is added it is aging and usually the feature is removed in next release. The people are notified at least for the first time, 
when they are about to use deprecated feature. Security related breaking changes are treated as minor change and released in a release 
containing only the security change. There is an option to stay with the older less secure behavior for some time.
The predictability of the releases is important part of the support they receive.
There is an impact on the marketing as some releases contain less attractive features than other releases.
The Node.js didn't experience strong push towards the prolongation of support after the maintenance of release ended.
