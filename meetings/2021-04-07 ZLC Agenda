1) PI Planning prep meeting yesterday 
- Team would like a "ZLC status of the business" review (and report on metrics) - Mike D, Peter and Bruce to create with input from anyone
else 
- Mike D - can you help with 1Q summary? 
- What I heard was maybe more "vision" on our view for Zowe and less gold stars on squad line items (since we were just duplicating 
squad plans) 
- Also discussed having incubators report status and plans for the PI - SDK and Mobile maybe as part of CLI and Desktop, have Zebra
and Workflow WiZard report as standalone....(Bruce will reach out to Zebra, Mike we need to either ask WiZard team if they want to 
speak or maybe you speak for them?? 
- Nick - are we close to sending out invites to block time on calendars or we using OMP calendar site?

2) TSC asked for policy in incubators and promoting provject from incubator to sub-projects - we need to add that to charter update 
work (Mike B has another possible incubator so we should clarify the critera for acceptance.) 

3) Do we need any follow up with UK Bank re CLI on USS? 

4) Reminder April 21 OMP Zowe webinar
