1) I propose we (ZLC) vote on the Support Conformance proposal and work with the TSC (where needed) on addressing the open criteria of 
- What is core
- Authentication process 
- and defining active contributors 
 https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/182 
 I will send voting email out later today for the 6 ZLC members since we are still under the prior ZLC charter 

 2) See issue on Core https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/community-5c93e02fa70b456d35b8f0ed/issues/zowe/community/1207 - I think we agreed
 TSC owns the definition the ZLC should help. ZLC has an old issue https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/170 that I propose we close and use
 the TSC issue on this topic. 

 What is core today - squads and TSC have the authority to grow these components as they see fit (HA, VSAM, Redis,... ) - core = LTS. 
 - API ML
 - Desktop 
 - Zowe Explorer 
 - CLI ("vendor neutral" extensions) - SCS and FTP

 What is not "core" - incubators, samples, tech preview, vendor specific CLI extensions(?) - how do we view SDKs today?  

 What are the characteritics needed to be come core? Anything other than LTS (doc, included in reqular build, automated test, good 
 quality - whatever that means) - maybe a implementable separate component with integration? 

3) Future of ZLC https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220 - to align with TSC
