Broadcom members are having their own PI Planning this week and will not attend ZLC 

The repeating ZLC calendar invite either expired or was deleted when editted for a special ZLC call - I tried to reestablish the invite
- knowing conflicts with other squad calls still exist - ZLC needs to find new day and time (TSC to also find new day and time) - 
we want to coordinate so no conflicts - does anyone know status of TSC reschedule 

Quick recap of past meetings 
April 21 there was no meeting 
April 28 was Zowe PI Planning 
May 5 the following topics were discussed ad hoc 
- Support Conformance criteria is work in progress 
- Discussion on Container support being included in LTS - opinion was having container code and config data separated that future
changes (for Kubernetes or Docker compose) is matter of doc/scripting - discussion needed at squad and TSC meetings 
- Issue raised on the possible use of Mini-conda and whether IBM would contribute Python - (some internal discussions kicked offed) 
- Discussion on the fact that some customers don't like the "USS centric" nature of Zowe - seed of an ideas to allow "preview" of 
install to allow MVS-centric customers to control USS install scripts - has then been captured for TSC consideration? 
- Workflow wiZard - work in progress 
- Marist - no news 
- Plans are to announce the Jetbrains incubator on zowe.org when ready 
- Next quarterly webinar is July 21st - semi-annual survey needed then 



ZLC issues needing worked 
- New role for ZLC and ZAC 
- Defining incubation process (acceptance and promotion criteria) - promotion a TSC responsibility? 
- Setting up a Support Conformance Program
- Assist with Marist - Advising and assisting on boosting z/OS resources
- Listening to Zowe corporate consumers
    - Continued improvements to up-and-running experience â€“ addressed by new doc?
    - HA/FT 
    - Containerization (impact to Conformance criteria of z/OS components?)
    - Packaging (PSI support)
    - New version messaging/timing
