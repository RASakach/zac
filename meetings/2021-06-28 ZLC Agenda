3) Summary of lessons learned from Node team? (My parapgrasing)  New version every two years if that is what your consumers can absorb. 
Don't worry about marketing hype. Deprecate with warning messages. Issue a Security-only mod release if needed at a predictatble time 
that changes default behavior if needed. 

4) Michael Dawson (Node Community) mentioned vendors of node providing input to their community - he's willing to do a second call 
with the ZLC as we sort out our new charter. Some suggestions: 
https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/Strategic-Initiatives.md 
https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback
https://github.com/nodejs/next-10  

5) Interskill did announce the new Zowe badge https://interskill.com/course-catalog/Zowe-Fundamentals.html
