3) Summary of lessons learned from Node team? (My parapgrasing)  New version every two years if that is what your consumers can absorb. 
Don't worry about marketing hype. Deprecate with warning messages. Issue a Security-only mod release if needed at a predictatble time 
that changes default behavior if needed. Look at zowe-dev for more info 
https://openmainframeproject.slack.com/archives/CBW5ET69G/p1624877092021600
 Note: LTS yearly - 18 months to migrate - total lifespan 30 months 

4) Michael Dawson (Node Community) mentioned vendors of node providing input to their community - he's willing to do a second call 
with the ZLC as we sort out our new charter. Some suggestions: 
https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/Strategic-Initiatives.md 
https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback
https://github.com/nodejs/next-10  

5) Interskill did announce the new Zowe badge https://interskill.com/course-catalog/Zowe-Fundamentals.html 

6) Work continues on future of ZLC. Working session last week on how to differentiate the role with TSC.  
 https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220 - to align with TSC
