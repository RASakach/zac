        Last week we agreed to:
        - update the documentation to be ABSOLUTELY clear that Zowe does not endorse or validate commercial offerings (https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/issues/1963)
        - figure out how to enable vendors to feature compatible solutions that don't align with the conformance program (https://github.com/zowe/zac/issues/237)
        - explore possibilities for creating a test environment inclusive of those commercial offerings

      ii. Will revisit after we have a better idea about V2 LTS readiness
